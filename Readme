EIS-Based Wetting Defect Detection in Lithium-Ion Batteries
This repository contains the official MATLAB implementation and dataset for the paper:

Detecting electrolyte wetting defects in lithium-ion batteries based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy Published in Cell Reports Physical Science (2026).

1. Overview
This project proposes a data-driven quality monitoring framework for the electrolyte injection and wetting process in battery manufacturing. It integrates Physics-Informed Feature Engineering with a Few-Shot Learning (FSL) algorithm to identify wetting defects using only a limited number of labeled samples.

2. Requirements
Software: MATLAB R2022b or later.

3. Data structure
The raw impedance data is provided in Excel format (.xlsx), named 1#.xlsx to 100#.xlsx.
Samples 1# – 50#: Normal wetting cells (Labels: 0).
Samples 51# – 100#: Defective wetting cells (Labels: 1).
Data Format: Each file contains frequency ($Hz$), $Z_{real}$ ($\Omega$), and $Z_{imag}$ ($\Omega$).
